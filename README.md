Our AR game, 'Cali Hunt', takes a satire-filled, dark humor approach as it revolves around our close friend. Throughout the game, digital artifacts appear in the environment,
each prompting a personalized question about his life. This creates a unique and humorous interactive narrative that reflects a blend of AR exploration and trivia storytelling. 
Design and Implementation Choices We chose Unity as our primary development platform, incorporating AR Foundation to build the game for mobile devices.
- Mobile-First AR Experience: Leveraging device cameras and real-world tracking to displayAR artifacts.
- Personalized Storytelling: Each question reflects inside jokes or facts about our friend to enhance engagement.
- Minimal UI, Maximum Interaction: All interactions are done via camera-based detection and object interaction.
